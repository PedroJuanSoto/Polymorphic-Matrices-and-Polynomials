# Polymoaphic Matrices and Polynomials
Simple implementation of polymorphic datatype matrices and polynomials; i.e., one can make matrices with polynomial entries or polynomials with matrix coefficiants or matrices with polynomial entries whose coefficients are themselves matrices and so on ad infinitum. 
Also one can convert boolean functions to communication matrices and visa versa.
