# Polymorphic Matrices and Polynomials
Simple implementation of polymorphic datatype matrices and polynomials; i.e., one can make matrices with polynomial entries or polynomials with matrix coefficiants or matrices with polynomial entries whose coefficients are themselves matrices and so on ad infinitum. 

Two test applications are included: 

1) Creating Random matrices with coeffients in the finite field GF(2^k) 

2) One can convert boolean functions to communication matrices and visa versa.
